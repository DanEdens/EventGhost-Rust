# Action System Development Log

## Overview
This document tracks the progress and implementation details of the EventGhost Rust action system.

## Core Components Implemented

### Action Framework
- **Action Trait**: The core interface for all actions with methods for execution, configuration, and validation.
- **ActionResult**: A structure to hold the result of action execution including success status and return data.
- **ActionConfig**: A configuration container for actions with arguments and execution flags.
- **ActionGroup**: A container for organizing related actions into a hierarchy.
- **ActionManager**: Central manager for registering, finding, and executing actions.

### Flow Control Actions
1. **DelayAction**
   - Pauses execution for a specified duration
   - Configurable with millisecond precision
   - Supports all event types
   - Implemented with proper async/await semantics

2. **ConditionalAction**
   - Implements if/else flow control logic
   - Evaluates conditions based on:
     - Event payload content
     - Event type
     - Event source
     - Variables (framework in place, implementation pending)
     - Constants
   - Supports multiple comparison operators:
     - Equal/Not Equal
     - Contains/Starts With/Ends With
     - Greater Than/Less Than/Greater Than or Equal/Less Than or Equal
   - Executes different action sequences based on the condition result

3. **WhileLoopAction**
   - Repeatedly executes actions while a condition is true
   - Uses the same condition evaluation system as ConditionalAction
   - Includes safeguards against infinite loops with configurable max_iterations
   - Returns a success/failure result with the number of iterations executed

4. **ForLoopAction**
   - Executes actions a specified number of times
   - Flexible configuration options:
     - Simple count (0 to N-1)
     - Custom start, end, and step values
     - Support for negative step values for countdown loops
   - Includes validation to prevent infinite loops
   - Designed to integrate with a future variable system to track the current iteration

## Testing
- Comprehensive test suite for all actions
- Mock events, plugins, and tracking actions for validation
- Coverage for edge cases and error conditions
- Thread-safe test implementations using atomic counters

## Next Steps
1. **Action Configuration UI**: Create UI components for configuring actions
2. **System Actions**: Implement common system actions (execute program, etc.)
3. **Thread Management**: Add dedicated action execution thread and pooling
4. **Variable System**: Implement a robust variable system for storing and accessing values

## Technical Decisions

### Async Execution
All action execution is asynchronous to allow for:
- Non-blocking UI during long-running actions
- Parallel execution when appropriate
- Integration with async I/O operations

### Type Safety
The action system uses Rust's type system to ensure:
- Type-safe action configurations
- Safe downcasting of action types when needed
- Proper error handling and propagation

### Extensibility
The system is designed for extensibility:
- Plugins can register custom actions
- Actions can be grouped and nested
- Common functionality is shared through traits
