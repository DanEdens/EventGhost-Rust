## Lessons Learned
- Rust's ownership model requires careful design of event and plugin systems
- GTK4 migration takes significant effort but provides a more modern UI framework
- Mock implementations are crucial for testing in a UI-heavy application
- Need to balance Python compatibility with modern Rust idioms
- Consider approach for plugins: native Rust vs Python bridge vs both
