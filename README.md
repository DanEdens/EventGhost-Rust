- [x] Configuration persistence with JSON serialization
- [x] Drag-and-drop support for configuration items
- [x] Plugin system architecture
- [x] Event handling system
- [x] Logging system with filtering and search

### UI Components
- [x] Main window with menu bar and toolbar
- [x] Log window with real-time updates
- [x] Configuration tree view
- [x] Configuration dialogs for items:
  - [x] Plugins
  - [x] Folders
  - [x] Macros
  - [x] Events
  - [x] Actions

### Configuration Management
- [x] JSON-based configuration storage
- [x] Auto-save functionality
- [x] Hierarchical configuration structure
- [x] CRUD operations for all item types
- [x] Drag-and-drop reordering

   # Linux
   sudo apt install libgtk-4-dev
   ```
3. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/EventGhost-Rust.git
   cd EventGhost-Rust
   ```
4. Build the project:
